* emacs-25.1-mac-6.0 (2016-09-18)

** Fixed bugs

*** Several glitches in frame tabbing on macOS 10.12.
To address this issue in a simple and consistent way, we now round the
frame size according to the character size only on resize by mouse
dragging or changes of the `fullscreen' frame parameter.  This may
cause some incompatibility.

*** Fullscreen frames contain space at the top on OS X 10.10.

** Improvements

*** New variable `mac-frame-tabbing' specifying tabbing behavior of a
frame that is becoming visible on macOS 10.12.

*** C-x 5 5 ... behaves like the C-x 5 prefix, but temporarily changes
tabbing behavior if "5" is typed repeatedly on macOS 10.12.


* emacs-25.1-rc2-mac-5.91 (2016-08-22)

* emacs-25.1-rc1-mac-5.90 (2016-07-25)
Based on Emacs 25.1 release candidate.
Drop support for Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5.
Official git repository is https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac.git
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-07/msg01087.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Crash when closing a fullscreen frame on macOS 10.12 Beta.

*** Can't resize a frame by dragging its edge on macOS 10.12 Beta.

*** Cyrillic text composition in HELLO file is shown wrong with Menlo.

** Improvements

*** New functions `mac-export-frames', `mac-page-setup-dialog',
`mac-get-page-setup', and `mac-print-frames-dialog'.  They correspond
to x-* functions provided in the cairo build together with GTK+.


* emacs-24.5-mac-5.18 (2016-06-26)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-06/msg00601.html

** Fixed bugs

*** On OS X 10.11, the result of Typometer is much worse than that on
the NS port, although better than the both ports on OS X 10.10.  This
is because the Mac port manually defers and coalesces screen flushes
in order to work around slow flyspell.  This seems to be unnecessary
on OS X 10.11, and actually gives a reverse effect as above.

** Improvements

*** Emoji data is updated to Unicode 9.0.

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-04/msg00890.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Shrunken image size on a Retina display is wrong if it is created
from the raw data using genuine ImageMagick.
Reported by Sean Farley.

** Improvements

*** When you create an image from the raw data as opposed to a file,
you can now provide 2x data for high-resolution environments via the
`:data-2x' property.  It can be specified either as a property of the
image descriptor or as a text property of the first character of the
standard resolution data (if it is given as a string).


* emacs-24.5-mac-5.16 (2016-04-23)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2016-04/msg00648.html

** Fixed bugs

*** M-x tool-bar-mode RET for a fullheight/maximized frame fails on
its first invocation.

*** Wrong size calculations for 2x genuine imagemagick images.  For
example, (image-size (create-image "splash.png" 'imagemagick nil
:max-height 300)) is larger than the one without the :max-height
property if the frame is on a Retina display.

** Improvements

*** For frames on a Retina display, image-io/imagemagick image
descriptors involving non-integral transformations such as shrinking
or rotation are now processed with 2x pixel buffer even if the source
image file/data is for 1x.  For example, (insert-image (create-image
"gnus/gnus.png" 'imagemagick nil :max-height 100)) now looks crisper.

*** Org mode LaTeX fragments preview may also create 2x images.

Reported by James Reeves.

*** Hang when canceling pop-up dictionary with C-g on OS X 10.11.
Reported by Max Siegel.

** Improvements

*** Force clicking with a pressure-sensitive trackpad now pops up a
Quick Look window to look up the word under the pointer in the
dictionaries.
Note: This is currently hard-coded.  Also, unlike Command-Control-D or
three-finger tap, it is not easy or often impossible to specify the
region of the text you look up because down-mouse-1 event resets it.

Control Panel on OS X 10.11 (does not happen on OS X 10.11.1).

*** Changing a frame to/from fullboth does not make the frame key
window on OS X 10.11.

*** Making a fullboth frame fullscreen does not keep the tool bar
visibility on OS X 10.7 and later.

*** If the executable is built on an older OS/SDK and run on OS X
10.11, the frame placed in the left part of Split View gets maximized.
Reported by Alan Schmitt.

*** Crash when making a frame fullscreen/fullboth on Mac OS X 10.4.

*** Crash by infinite recursion while displaying box face.
Apply a fix for Bug#21428.

*** Crash when redisplaying a window changes faces or fonts.
Apply a fix for Bug#21428.

** Improvements

*** Fullscreen/fullboth frames no longer hide the Dock unnecessarily
if compiled and run on OS X 10.11.

*** Fullscreen transition animation looks a bit better on OS X 10.11.

** Fixed bugs

*** Crash when closing a fullscreen frame on OS X 10.11 GM Candidate.

*** Daemon mode does not exec after fork at startup.  This is a
regression introduced in 3.90.

*** Display corrupts when zooming twice quickly.

*** Crash when displaying etc/HELLO file on OS X 10.11 GM Candidate.
It crashes when displaying Oriya characters with Arial Unicode MS.
This happens even with TextEdit.app if you explicitly select the font.
A workaround is added so Oriya Sangam MN is preferred by default.

** Improvements

*** Extend mode line areas while showing resize transition animation.

** Fixed bugs

*** Crash when pressing Command + power button on OS X 10.9 and later.

** Improvements

*** Accept localized font family names on Mac OS X 10.6 and later.

*** Some resize operations on OS X 10.7 and later now involve
transition animations by decomposing and distributing the current
contents.  Examples include dragging with shift/option key pressed,
zooming, and dragging full screen tiling border on OS X 10.11 Beta.

*** New global minor mode `mac-auto-operator-composition-mode'.  If
enabled, it composes consecutive ASCII symbolic characters into a
special glyph when the font supports such a composition typically via
ligatures for operators in programming languages.  Tested with Hasklig
and Fira Code.

*** System-wide popups (such as "Emoji & Symbols") are placed wrong
when the cursor is at end of line.

*** The symbol `left' for mac-right-*-modifier variables is not
properly presented in customization buffers.

** Improvements

*** Support ZWJ (ZERO WIDTH JOINER) sequences for emoji on OS X 10.10.3.

*** Now the `:button' property in the value of a modifier variable
(e.g., `mac-option-modifier') can be used for mapping button numbers.

Blend-and-blur of background color on OS X 10.10 is enabled again
because the mode-line erasure issue (Bug#19721) is fixed upstream.
The function `do-applescript' is now an alias of `mac-do-applescript',
which is implemented on top of `mac-osa-script'.


* emacs-24.4-mac-5.3 (2015-01-29)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-01/msg01040.html

Blend-and-blur of background color on OS X 10.10 is temporarily
disabled to avoid mode-line erasure on frame focus switch.  For some
reason, mode-line row's `enabled_p' flag in the current matrix is
sometimes reset even if it is visible.  This causes blank mode-line on
"expose" (drawRect:) events.  In principle, this mode-line erasure can
also happen on older versions of OS X or this version of Emacs Mac
port.  But it is usually observed on OS X 10.10 together with previous
5.x versions of Emacs Mac port, because the use of NSVisualEffectView,
which provides the blend-and-blur feature, triggers full frame
"exposure" on focus switch.

** Fixed bugs

*** Special-display completion frame becomes transparent.
Reported by Alan Shumitt.
Adapt a fix for Bug#16619.

*** `mac-auto-ascii-mode' on TTY terminals disables prefix keys with
the meta key.

*** Control-F2 is passed to the system even if
mac-pass-control-to-system is set to nil.

*** Synthetic bold text looks thinner on Retina display/HiDPI mode.
This is because stroke line width for text drawing is not correctly
scaled (whereas it is correctly scaled when drawn to bitmaps) on such
environments.  I've been reporting this to Apple on every OS X update
since it was 10.7.4, but I couldn't get any response until recently.
At last Apple answers that there are no plans to address this issue
(rdar://11644870) currently.  So I added a workaround that would cause
a bad reverse effect if the original issue were fixed.

*** `mac-ae-set-reply-parameter', which is used for reporting an error
in Apple event hander, has not been working since emacs-24.2-mac-3.2.

*** Input source functions ignore disabled input source ID strings.

** Improvements

*** URL handler via Apple events now accepts the `org-protocol' scheme
as well as `mailto'.


* emacs-24.4-mac-5.2 (2014-11-21)

** Fixed bugs

*** The function `mac-osa-script' does not process ARGS (6th and later
arguments) correctly.

** Improvements

*** Even if the current keyboard layout maps some key with the control
modifier to insertion of a character, which would be recognized as an
ordinary insertion in applications that use the standard Cocoa text
view, it is interpreted as a combination with the control modifier.
This behavior is consistent with the Mac port version 4.x and earlier,
and also obviates the previous fix for "C-_" on JIS keyboard.

*** If /usr/include does not exist, then the Xcode SDK dir is examined
as a candidate of libxml2 header location if it does not contain any
special characters or blanks.

*** The function `mac-osa-script' now accepts compiled code, which can
be generated by a new function `mac-osa-compile', and a file name as
well as a script source.
Note: As of OS X 10.10.1, specifying compiled code generated from a
JavaScript source causes crash.  I think this is a bug in OSAKit.

*** New function `mac-do-applescript', which is implemented on top of
`mac-osa-script' and intended as a future replacement of
`do-applescript'.

*** New functions and hooks for interaction with the Text Input Source
Services on Mac OS X 10.5 and later: `mac-input-source',
`mac-input-source-list', `mac-select-input-source',
`mac-deselect-input-source',
`mac-selected-keyboard-input-source-change-hook', and
`mac-enabled-keyboard-input-sources-change-hook'.

*** New global minor mode `mac-auto-ascii-mode' for Mac OS X 10.5 and
later.  If enabled, it automatically selects the most-recently-used
ASCII-capable keyboard input source on some occasions: after prefix
key (bound in the global keymap) press such as C-x and M-g, and at the
start of minibuffer input.
Note: Strictly speaking, its implementation has a timing issue: the
Lisp event queue may already have some input events that have been
processed by some previous keyboard input source but yet to be
processed by the Lisp interpreter.

*** "C-_" on JIS keyboard is recognized as "_".
Reported by OHKAWA Yuichi.

*** Checking "Reduce translucency" in the Accessibility pane in the
System Preferences on OS X 10.10 makes fringe areas translucent.
Reported by Nicholas Riley.

** Improvements

*** Blend-and-blur of fringe background on OS X 10.10 is no longer
hard-coded.  It can be customized per face by specifying a special
name `alpha:ALPHA' as a value of the background stipple attribute.
For example,
  (set-face-stipple 'fringe "alpha:50%")
or
  defaults write org.gnu.Emacs Emacs.fringe.attributeStipple alpha:.5
will (mostly) recover the appearance of the previous release.
Note: Setting stipple for the default face may not work as you expect.
This is the same limitation as the standard stipple feature on X11.
Also, blend-and-blur is temporarily turned off during animations.

*** New experimental functions `mac-osa-language-list' and
`mac-osa-script'.  The latter is like `do-applescript', but can
execute JavaScript as well as AppleScript on OS X 10.10.

Reported by Leo.

*** If you point to the left "%", which has both left and right
overhangs for Monaco 12pt, of "%%" in the mode line, then the right
one is also drawn with upper and lower box.

** Improvements

*** New variables mac-right-control-modifier,
mac-right-command-modifier, and mac-right-option-modifier.
Note: the left and right versions cannot be distinguished on some
environments such as Screen Sharing.  Also, certain combinations of a
key with both versions of the same modifier do not emit events at the
system level.

*** A single physical modifier key can be mapped to different Emacs
modifiers depending on its input type (ordinary keys, function keys,
or mouse operations) using the property list format `(:ordinary SYMBOL
:function SYMBOL :mouse SYMBOL)'.  By default, the option key works as
the normal Mac option key for the ordinary keys, and as the Alt
modifier for the function keys and the mouse operations.

Based on Emacs 24.3.90.
High-resolution icons are now distributed as a separate package.
File notification is supported via GLib (you'll also need `pkg-config'
when running the configure command).
The `image-io' image type supports `:max-width', `:max-height', and
`:format' keywords just as in `imagemagick'.
Now that Image mode supports multi-frame image navigation (`f', 'b',
and `F'), you can browse multi-page documents in several formats that
`image-io' supports (e.g., PDF and DOC) with the setting like this:
  (when (and (image-type-available-p 'image-io)
	     (not (boundp 'imagemagick-render-type)))
     ;; Image I/O is used as a fallback of ImageMagick.

     (setq imagemagick-types-inhibit
	  (cons 'XML (delq 'PDF imagemagick-types-inhibit)))

Note: if you have ImageMagick installed, you need to build the Mac
port executable without the genuine ImageMagick support so `image-io'
can be used as a fallback of `imagemagick'.

monitor does not appear automatically by moving the mouse to the place
where the menu bar was.  I suspect this is a bug in AppKit.

*** Battery status is not shown correctly on OS X 10.9.
Apply a fix for bug#15694 by Masashi Fujimoto and Glenn Morris.

** Improvements

*** Double clicking an emoji character in the Character Viewer now
complements the Variation Selector 16 if the character is sensitive to
the selector.

*** The image type `image-io' can now additionally rasterize data in
several document formats.  The list of supported formats can be
obtained by `(image-io-types)'.

** Fixed bugs

*** Invocation via "Login Items" or "Resume" does not respect PATH
setting in ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist on OS X 10.7 and earlier.
Note: OS X 10.8 does not use ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist anyway.

*** Spotlight in Help menu is not installed on Mac OS X 10.5 if
language setting is other than English.

*** Closing a window causes crash if compiled with ARC.
This primarily happens with the latest clang Apple LLVM version 5.0,
but also with earlier versions if the memory leak below is fixed.

*** Memory leaks with ARC on clang Apple LLVM version 4.2 (possibly
compiler bug).

** Improvements

*** Try built-in libxml2 on OS X 10.8 as a fallback.

*** Invoking Service producing output does not replace the selected
text.
Reported by Nicholas Riley.

*** Invoking Service via C-mouse-down-1 may not insert the output
correctly.

** Improvements

*** Add sound support.  Like on other platforms, it is synchronous and
you cannot quit it with C-g.

*** Round frame bottom corners on OS X 10.7 and later, even when
internal-border-width is 0.

*** Disabling tool bar mode via the Preference system (X resources
emulation) does not work.
Reported by Leo.

*** Tool bar visibility is not preserved when entering/exiting full
screen on Mac OS X 10.7 and later (actually this is a bug in AppKit).

*** Background color is not in sRGB color space for image types GIF,
PNG, TIFF, and IMAGE-IO.

** Improvements

*** You can run the executable from the build directory (via `open
mac/Emacs.app') without doing `make install'.  Forgot to mention in
the previous release.

*** Support alpha channel masks for image types GIF, PNG, TIFF, and
IMAGE-IO with keeping the postprocessing functionality (`:conversion'
and `:mask').  Not for SVG images rendered with WebKit because proper
text smoothing requires opaque background.

*** Full screen transition animations are not correct on OS X 10.8.

*** XBM foreground and background are not in sRGB color space.

*** mac-file-alias-p returns t for symbolic links on Mac OS X 10.6 and
later.
Reported by Leo.

*** Scroll bar thumb dragging is not right on Mac OS X 10.6 and
earlier (regression by the previous fix for Mac OS X 10.7 and later.)

** Improvements

*** Help key no longer activates "context help mode" (question-mark
mouse pointer).

*** Popup menu shown by C-mouse-down-1 now includes contextual menu on
Mac OS X 10.6 and later.  Other popup menus remain quiet.

*** Some combinations of regional indicator symbols such as U+1F1EF
followed by U+1F1F5 now display national flags in color emoji on Mac

** Fixed bugs

*** Preferred font family selection does not work on OS X 10.8.

** Improvements

*** If Emacs.app is launched from Finder or via Resume on OS X 10.8,
then it inherits environment variable settings of user's login shell
regardless of the existence of ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist, which is
ignored on OS X 10.8 anyway.

*** Use sRGB color space instead of device RGB.  This does not change
the appearance on OS X 10.8 which regards device RGB as sRGB.

** Fixed bugs

*** Scrolling up the contents of a buffer with a header line by mouse
wheel is sometimes jumpy.

*** Several glitches on PowerPC (such as not displaying fringe
bitmaps) due to overlooked WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN -> WORDS_BIGENDIAN change.

*** SVG image (rendered via WebKit) might be clipped if width or
height is unspecified.
Reported by Leo.
Now use max X or Y value of the bounding box if width or height is
specified as a percentage value or unspecified.

*** Double-tapping either a touch-sensitive mouse with one finger or a
trackpad with two fingers on Mac OS X 10.8 64-bit build is ignored.

** Improvements

*** Double-tapping either a touch-sensitive mouse with one finger or a
trackpad with two fingers on Mac OS X 10.7 and later now scales the
text to 150% if previously unscaled and the pointer lies between the
indentation and end of line.

*** Text scaling by gestures now tries to keep the vertical position
of the text under the pointer.

*** Support automatic selection of high resolution versions of images.
All supported image types respect the "@2x" file name convention.  SVG
images (via WebKit or librsvg) are rendered according to the backing
scale factor.  An appropriate image is selected from a multiimage TIFF
containing both 1x and 2x images if the image spec does not contain an
explicit `:index' property.

*** Prefer the integrated GPU to the discrete one for saving battery.
This requires Mac OS X 10.7 and Early 2011 MacBook Pro.

`page-curl-with-shadow' transition on Mac OS X 10.7 with HiDPI mode.

*** Wrong display of animations on Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 when

*** Incomplete input area (aka "active input area", "marked text", or
"preedit area") does not respect buffer text scaling.

** Improvements

*** Animation now supports the built-in Core Image transition filters
via Core Animation.  The "About Emacs" and "Preferences..." menu items
in the application menu (labeled "Emacs") in the menu bar are
accompanied with a transition animation effect on Mac OS X 10.5 and
later.  Animation is suppressed if the frame is not completely opaque,
because it does not give an intended effect on such frames.

Known issues: The `page-curl' transition does not look right on Mac OS
X 10.5.  Also, the `page-curl-with-shadow' transition does not look
right for some angles on Mac OS X 10.7.4.  Both transitions look
blurry on Mac OS X 10.7.4 with HiDPI mode.

*** HiDPI mode shows wrong animation on transition from/to full screen.

*** M-x electric-pair-mode RET gives the warning "Note, built-in

*** Momentum scroll events after horizontal flicking interfere with a
multi-key sequence.

*** "Emacs" (in the menu bar) -> "About Emacs" then typing "q" causes
an error.

** Improvements

*** Support right-to-left text shaping.

*** New variable `mac-system-move-file-to-trash-use-finder', which
enables us to use the Finder for trashing so we can `Put Back' the
trashed items from the context menu.

*** Buffer switching by horizontal swiping/flicking and exiting from

Be aware of the (platform-independent) change in selection:
mouse-dragging no longer automatically copies the selected text to the
clipboard without M-w or `Copy' in the menu bar or the tool bar,
unless you set `mouse-drag-copy-region' to t.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-03/msg00030.html

** Fixed bugs

*** If compiled with ARC, "Emacs" (in the menu bar) -> "About Emacs"
leads to crash.

*** Emacs -q --eval "(set-frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen 'fullboth)"
does not hide the menu bar.
Reported by Leo.

** Improvements

*** New image type `image-io', which is parallel to `imagemagick' but
uses the Image I/O framework.  If not configured to link with the
ImageMagick library, then `image-io' provides a fallback
implementation of the `imagemagick' image type.

*** The variable `tool-bar-style' works like in GTK+.  The values
`both-horiz', `text-image-horiz' are synonymous with `both'.

*** Flicking either a touch-sensitive mouse with one finger or a
trackpad with two fingers horizontally issues a swipe-left/swipe-right
event, which is now bound to a simple buffer switching by default.

*** Memory leak by y-or-n-p-with-timeout with GUI (Bug#9830).

** Improvements

*** Can compile with ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) on Xcode 4.2.
Specify CC="clang -fobjc-arc" on configure.

*** When running Ediff on a fullboth frame, it no longer gets obscured
by the menu bar or the Dock even if we focus Ediff Control Panel.

*** Devanagari string U+0936 U+094D U+0930 U+093F (3 consonants
followed by 1 vowel, but the glyph corresponding to the last vowel
should be displayed first) is displayed wrong and may cause hang.
Reported by Tsuyoshi YASUMA.

*** Executables compiled on Mac OS X 10.6 with
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.5 do not run on Mac OS X 10.5.  This is a
regression introduced in 1.9994.
Note: executables compiled on Mac OS X 10.7 with
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 and some optimization flag still do not
run on Mac OS X 10.6, but I think this is a bug about weak linking in
the compiler or linker in Xcode 4.1 and already reported to Apple.

*** Updating display while a frame is resized from the bottom-right
corner does not work via Screen Sharing.  This is a regression
introduced in 1.9993.

*** Updating display while a frame is resized does not work from
non-bottom-right corners or edges on Mac OS X 10.7.

*** SVG display by WebKit is disabled on 64-bit executables.

*** The "Special Characters ..." item in the "Edit" menu doesn't
appear in non-English locales.

*** LastResort font is not shown on Mac OS X 10.7.

*** Pointer shape around the edges/corners becomes the pointing arrow
rather than the resizing arrows on Mac OS X 10.7 when mouse moved.

** Improvements

*** Support for the full screen mode introduced in Mac OS X 10.7.
Now `fullscreen' and `fullboth' values for the `fullscreen' frame
parameter have different meanings on Mac OS X 10.7: the former means a
new system-wide full screen mode with a dedicated desktop (or Space),
and the latter means the existing fullscreen feature.

Known issues: the menu bar does not appear with Control-F2 or
Command-Shift-/, and the tool bar is shown when mouse is moved to the
top even when tool-bar-mode is turned off.  I think these are bugs
(already reported to Apple), and I'd like to see if the situation
is changed with some future OS updates rather than tweaking with some
workarounds.

*** On Mac OS X 10.7, double-tapping either a touch-sensitive mouse
with one finger or a trackpad with two fingers changes the buffer text
scaling to unscaled if previously scaled.  And if previously unscaled,
then the buffer text is scaled so the default font occupies at least
`mac-text-scale-standard-width' columns in the tapped window.

*** Drag-and-drop highlights the frame under the pointer.

*** Option key temporarily inverts the "Jump to the spot that's

*** Option key temporarily changes the behavior of line-up/down scroll
bar buttons to page-up/down as in other applications.

*** Holding shift key on startup is recognized as -Q option.

** Notes

*** This release is meant to make minimal adjustment for Mac OS X
10.7.  Don't expect integration with new features of Lion except the
color emoji display support mentioned above.

*** SVG support by WebKit is disabled on 64-bit executables for now,
because it may hang while initializing plugins in some cases.  If you
do need SVG display, then build as a 32-bit executable or use librsvg.

Command-Shift-/ doesn't work on Mac OS X 10.6.  These are regressions
caused by the previous fix for the DefaultKeyBinding.dict problem.

*** Successive paste of the same image from other applications via the
clipboard causes duplication in the kill ring.  Reported by Leo.  This
is a regression caused by the previous fix.

*** Fonts in highlighted words with the pop-up dictionary
(Command-Control-D) are sometimes incorrect.  This is a regression
caused by refactoring for the accessibility support.

** Improvements

*** Font design destination can be specified via the `:destination'
font property.  The value 1 means the destination is video text as in
the XLFD Conventions, and screen font metrics are used in that case.
You can see the difference with (make-frame '((font
. "Monaco-9:antialias=off:destination=1"))), for example.

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-05/msg00951.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Prefix keys defined in ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict
need to be typed multiple times.  Reported by Peter Dyballa and Drew Hess.

*** Successive paste of different images from other applications via
the clipboard only inserts the first image.  Reported by Leo.

*** Successive SVG image loading in `vrend-clock' by Anders Waldenborg
(http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2010-05/msg00521.html)
fails in a few seconds.

*** The variable `face-ignored-fonts' does not work.
Apply Kenichi Handa's fix for Bug#6287.
This is useful when you want to turn off synthetic bold for some fonts
like (add-to-list 'face-ignored-fonts "\\`-[^-]*-monaco-bold-").
Synthetic bold seems to become lighter if the background is darker
than the foreground and the LCD font smoothing is turned on.

** Improvements

*** "Speak selected text with when the key is pressed", which can be
customized in the Speech pane in the System Preferences, now works.

*** New events: magnify-up/down and rotate-left/right.  They are for
newer trackpads with Mac OS X 10.5.2 and later.  By default,
magnify-up/down, which are issued by pinch out/in, are bound to
scaling text size by text-scale-mode.  With the shift key, they turn
on/off fullscreen status of the frame.

*** Experimental support for accessibility with respect to the custom
view for Emacs frames.  Still there are several glitches.

** Improvements

*** Very experimental support for mouse wheel smooth scroll.  This
still has several glitches especially with respect to tall lines, so
disabled by default for now.  You can try this by setting
`mac-mouse-wheel-smooth-scroll' to t.  Note that this feature might be
withdrawn later.

** Fixed bugs

*** Tooltips don't respect customized `tooltip' face font setting.

*** Font specs specified for non-ASCII characters in a non-default
fontset are not used in new frames.  Reported by Ichiro Enoki.

** Improvements

*** New function `mac-file-alias-p', which is parallel to
`file-symlink-p'.

** Fixed bugs

*** 64-bit binary built on Mac OS X 10.5 does not run on 10.6.

*** `make bootstrap' fails (though it is not required for normal
installation).  Reported by Leo.

** Improvements

*** `do-applescript' regards a given multibyte string as Unicode text.
It behaves as in Emacs 22 if the script is given as a unibyte string.

** Fixed bugs

*** Crash when showing a tooltip on a secondary monitor.

*** Can't quit while establishing a TCP connection.
Apply a fix for Bug#5723 as well as Helmut Eller's fix for Bug#5173.

** Improvements

*** When a maximized frame is moved with title bar dragging on a
multiple monitor environment, the destination monitor is determined by
the mouse position at the end of dragging.  If such a frame is moved
programmatically, the destination monitor is determined by the maximum
area of the contained part of the frame as before.

*** Menu item "Open Selected File in Emacs" is shown in Services or
context menu of other applications by default on Mac OS X 10.6 when
absolute pathname-like text is selected.

*** Emacs info nodes are accessible via search field in the Help menu
if compiled and run on Mac OS X 10.6.

*** "Click in the scroll bar to: Jump to the spot that's clicked"
setting in the System Preferences is supported.

** Fixed bugs

*** Dictionary popped up with Command-Control-D is misplaced when a
word in a partially-visible line is looked up.

*** Drag-n-dropping a file into a Message buffer opens the file
instead of adding it as an attachment.  Reported by Leo.

*** Crash when a text is drag-n-dropped into the Dock icon.
Reported by Leo.

*** Not registered as a service provider on Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier,
even if there is no other instance of running Emacs.

*** Modifier mapping for the `fn' key does not work with the `A' key.

** Improvements

*** Reverse conversion in Kotoeri works even without selection.
Hitting Eisu/Kana key on JIS keyboard (or Control-Shift-;/J/K on US
keyboard) twice also works.

Based on Emacs 23.1.93

** Fixed bugs

*** Menu selection via search field in the Help menu doesn't work on
Mac OS X 10.6.
Note: this seems to be still unstable on Mac OS X 10.5.8, crashing at
the function TestMenuSystemAttributes in the HIToolbox framework.
I've experienced similar crashes even with Safari on that version.

*** The function `menu-bar-open' does not activate the menu bar.

*** Menu bar does not get updated after Command-H -> Dock icon click
on Mac OS X 10.5.

** Improvements

*** Scroll bars are excluded from flashed area for visible bell in a
consistent way.

*** Several keyboard shortcuts (notably those for Keyboard Navigation)
listed in System Preferences now work.

Based on Emacs 23.1.92

** Fixed bugs

*** Turning on the toolbar in a fullscreen frame leaves garbage if it
has non-zero internal border width.

** Improvements

*** When the clipboard has both textual and image data, yank inserts
the former and push both into the kill ring so the latter can be
inserted with yank-pop afterwards.

*** Use non-integral x positions for displaying antialiased
proportional fonts.  You can see the difference by putting the box
cursor over Helvetica 12pt `I', whose ideal width is 3.33398 but
displayed with the rounded width 3, for example.

** Fixed bugs

*** The `fullboth' frames, which don't have a title bar, are not shown
in the window list in the Dock menu.

*** Mouse highlighting is not updated on popup (de)activations.

*** With `x-select-font', the first click in a list sometimes results
in a wrong selection.

*** Command line options specifying temporary preferences settings
(e.g., -AppleDisplayScaleFactor 1.25 -AppleAntiAliasingThreshold 14),
just as in other Cocoa applications, are regarded as if they are
specifying filenames to edit.

** Improvements

*** Change of text smoothing threshold setting in the Appearance pane
of the System Preferences is now reflected immediately.

** Fixed bugs

*** Can't get Unicode Variation Sequences subtable for Hanazono font
(2009-12-01, TTF) on Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier.

** Improvements

*** Fullscreen works like with ewmh-compliant X11 window managers.
Note: currently, `fullboth' frames, which don't have a title bar, are
not shown in the window list in the Dock menu.

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-11/msg00001.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Kill/yank in tty frames causes an error.

** Improvements

*** When delete-selection-mode is enabled, then the active region is
hidden while the marked text is being shown (so "Reverse conversion"
in Kotoeri looks better).

*** The current cursor position may be returned for a character
position query for text input even if the marked text is not displayed
or handled at the Lisp level yet (so auxiliary windows in AquaSKK 4
are placed better.)

*** SVG images are supported via WebKit on Mac OS X 10.4 and later.
If you have librsvg installed and you want to use WebKit for rendering
SVG images, then you need to specify --without-rsvg as a configure
option.

*** The Mac font backend driver now supports `get_variation_glyphs'
also on Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier.

*** Ideographic Variation Sequences (IVSes) also work for Hiragino
fonts, which don't have a format 14 (Unicode Variation Sequences)
subtable in their cmap table.

** Fixed bugs

*** Conversion between Lisp and NSPasteboard strings doesn't preserve
NUL characters.

*** Mouse face reacts even while tracking Dock menus or Stacks.

*** Control-Q does not work as the quote binding in file dialogs.

*** Synthetic bold does not work for bitmap-only fonts on Mac OS X
10.6.

** Improvements

*** New events: wheel-left/right as in W32, and
swipe-up/down/left/right on Mac OS X 10.5.2 and later.

*** The Mac font backend driver now supports `get_variation_glyphs' on
Mac OS X 10.5 and later.  You need some OpenType font containing a
format 14 (Unicode Variation Sequences) subtable in its cmap table.

*** Simplified `select' emulation also for Mac OS X 10.5 and earlier.
Its design is similar to the one in the previous release with Grand
Central Dispatch.

*** Command-Control-D doesn't pop up dictionary on Mac OS X 10.6.

*** Iconified frames aren't considered visible.
Reported by Benjamin Riefenstahl.

*** Can't make iconified frames invisible.

** Improvements

*** Fall back on mac-system-coding-system if script and language
information is not available in text input events.

*** New implementation for the `select' emulation using Grand Central
Dispatch instead of CFSocket.  It is enabled by default if built for
Mac OS X 10.6.  If you find it unstable/problematic, then you can turn
it off by compiling with "-DSELECT_USE_GCD=0".

** Fixed bugs

*** Doesn't build on Mac OS X 10.6.

*** Multi-page TIFF images are not supported.
I thought they were, but I actually added the code to another working
tree and forgot to merge it in the previous version.

*** "Visit New File" shows a wrong dialog.
Apply Jason Rumney's fix for Bug#3969.

*** Mach port right leaks due to the previous change for the warning
"CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed".

** Improvements

*** File and font dialogs can be closed with C-g on Mac OS X 10.5 and later.

*** "open -g" (available on Mac OS X 10.5 and later) does not work.

*** Control-Tab is not recognized on Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier.

** Improvements

*** Resizing truncates the window width/height to multiple of the
nominal character size instead of rounding unless the resizing is
triggered by mouse dragging of the resize handle.

*** Warning "CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed" with
multiple invocations via command-line or "open -n" is suppressed
(except for Mac OS X 10.4).

*** Crash when calculating Quickdraw font metrics in an invisible frame.

*** Crash when changing internal-border-width of an invisible frame.

*** Assertion failure in mac_set_font.

*** "Hide" in Login Items does not work.

*** (mac-pasteboard-string-to-string "\342\204\246" 'mac-roman) gives
GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA instead of OHM SIGN (likewise for
mac-utxt-to-string).

*** mac-symbol -> emacs-mule mapping is represented wrong for #x30 - #x37.

*** Tooltip contents are chopped off if the fractional part of the
scaling factor is greater than or equal to 0.5.

*** Crash with tooltip autodisplay that happens when its contents are
not yet ready.

*** (do-applescript "choose file") -> cancel -> hang on 10.5.

*** With asynchronous subprocesses, the "[Complete, but not unique]"
message shown by C-x C-f / TAB TAB will disappear on key release.
(Both Carbon and Carbon+Appkit)

*** Crash with tabbar.el (not specific to the Carbon(+AppKit) port).
http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1337

** Improvements

*** Execution of flyspell-small-region is no longer too slow.

*** The "Visit New File" dialog no longer confirms replacement if an
existing file is specified (only on 10.3 and later).

*** Update display while the resize control (or the slider in the font
panel) is being dragged.

*** Align key bindings shown in a menu.

*** Explicitly link with libncurses.5 if MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET <
1040 to avoid runtime link error when running on the versions without
/usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib.
